    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Catching Balls Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). </p>
	
	
	 <p>This is a game where the user will be catching falling red balls from the top of a window, once they have succesfully attained a score of 35, the user 		will win the game. If the user misses too many balls and gets a score of -3, the game ends and a loss screen is shown. The user interacts with the game 	by moving their mouse across the window in order to gain score.</p>
	
	 <p>This game helped develop my understandings of variables and if statements in order to properly count the score the user was attaining and the positions 	of the players cursor and the red circles falling from the top of the window and their positions.</p>
